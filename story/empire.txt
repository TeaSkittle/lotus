I'll get straight to the point. The reason for these logs of mine is to 
expose the company in which I used to work for: Proxy. I am sure you 
know of them, they are the main reason for cybernetics enhancements we 
see in today's society. Now most of what they have done can be seen as good,
but that is just what the media portrays. 

When I worked for Proxy I was assigned to their weapons divisions as a
programmer. I helped create the cybernetic and prosthetic weapons we see in
various government agencies. But there are other parties out there using
this technology, some more nefarious than others.

Let's test your skills some more, and see how serious you really are about
this... situation of mine. If you can connect to 192.168.10.5, you might
just have some potential that I can trust. Once you are there, see what you
can find.
