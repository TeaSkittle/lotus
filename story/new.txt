Greetings Hacker,
I must say, I am already impressed that you have made it this far. Most
people nowadays would have issues finding their way around LotusOS, so
you are smarter than most. I hope that intelligence will guide you along
the right path.

Now it's time to connect to one of the pc's in Proxy's headquarters. Here
is the ip: 127.0.2.12

From here on out things wont be quite so easy. Once you are in the system,
find the file named: new_hire.txt. In there will lay the next clue for you.
